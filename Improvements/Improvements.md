## Improvements #1 - [Member - Mobile & Desktop ] Scroll to top button

Current: User doesn't have the option to go on top of the page besides
scrolling back.

Requested: Add 'Scroll on top' button that will scroll all the way to
top when is clicked.

Reason: User can scroll far down the page, so adding this feature will
save users time.

## Improvements #2 - [Member page] - Cancel benefit subscription by clicking the X

Current: After subscribing to benefit only way for user to unsubscribe
is to go back to the subscribed benefit card, open it and unsubscribe.

Requested: Allow user to unsubscribe from benefit by clicking the X
button on the green window pop up that appears on top of the screen
after subscribing.

Reason: User would faster cancel benefit if it was subscribed non
intentionally.

## Improvements #3 - [HR>Employees/Refunds - Mobile] - Close navigation sidebar by clicking outside of sidebar.

Current: If user want to close the navigation sidebar it can be done by
clicking the small 'x' icon in the left top corner.

Requested: Allow user to close sidebar by clicking outside blue sidebar.

Reason: Since the 'x' icon is small user would have trouble finding it,
also user could think it is part of the logo since they are the same
color. Many apps use this way of closing sidebars and by adding this
feature the app will have better user experience.

## Improvements #4 - Rename Dashboard page to Statistics

Current: Name of landing page is Dashboard.
Requested: Rename landing page to 'Statistics' and change its icon in
navigation menu.
Reason: Renaming it will fulfill pages meaning since the whole page
consists of many containers with charts and functionalities for
generating reports.

## Improvements #5 - [Member - Desktop] Place filter options above benefit cards

Current: Filter options are located on the right side of the page.

Requested: Place filter options between 4 buttons(browse buttons,
company benefits..) and heading 'Browse benefits'. Make that container
to be horizontal.

Reason: Since F-shaped reading pattern (reading in shape of letter 'F')
is the most common, when a user lands on this page, the filter
option will be on top of the list that the user first saw.

## Improvements #6 - [Member - Mobile & Desktop] Font size on Benefit card is too small.

Current: CategoryTag text has font size 11px, Cities text has font size 12px and price text has a font size 12px and font weight normal. 

Requested: Change font size of CategoryTag text to 12px and font weight to 500. Change font size of Cities text to 14px. Price text change to 14px and font weight to 600. 

Reason: With these font changes user will fastly see important things on that benefit card.

## Improvements #7 - \[Member - Desktop\] Align benefit cards on left side.

Current: Benefit cards are aligned on center 

Requested: Align benefit cards on the left side of the container. 

Reason: By left aligning it is easier for the user to follow along. It's also creating symmetry on the screen and capturing attention.
